Installation for development of **CMTools**
===========================================

**CMTools** is an experimental, proof of concept, set of tools for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python or Go programming projects. It provides a `cmt` command line program.

Quick install with curl or irm
------------------------------

There is an experimental installer.sh script that can be run with the following command to install latest table release. This may work for macOS, Linux and if youâ€™re using Windows with the Unix subsystem. This would be run from your shell (e.g. Terminal on macOS).

~~~shell
curl https://caltechlibrary.github.io/CMTools/installer.sh | sh
~~~

This will install `cmt` in your `$HOME/bin` directory.

If you are running Windows 10 or 11 use the Powershell command below.

~~~ps1
irm https://caltechlibrary.github.io/CMTools/installer.ps1 | iex
~~~

Installing from source
----------------------

### Required software

1. Git (to clone the cold repository on GitHub)
2. Deno >= 2.1.4

### Compiling **CMTools**

Deno is used to compile the TypeScript and dependent JavaScript files into an executable.

1. Install handlebars via Deno
2. Use Deno's task to build project

~~~shell
deno install npm:handlebars
deno task build
~~~

This will provide the `cmt` command in the "bin" folder in your repository directory.

You can check to make sure `cmt` works for your system. The compiled version is self contain and can be copied someplace in your path. 

### Manual install on POSIX

~~~shell
mkdir -p $HOME/bin
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
cp bin/cmt $HOME/bin/
export MANPATH="$MANPATH:$HOME/man"
cp -vR man $HOME/
~~~

### Manual install for Windows via Powershell

~~~ps1
mkdir $HOME/bin
$PATH = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "$PATH;$HOME/bin")
copy ./bin/cmt.exe $HOME/bin/
~~~
